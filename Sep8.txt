- list and tuple can both have a mix of types, still not clear on the difference - apparently they are interchangeable but its a mental thing () vs []
- dictionaries {
	- can mix key and values
	- {} makes an empty dictionary
	- h[<key>] = <value> will either edit teh key value or add the key and value
	- use dictionary[key] to get value and set it
	- set of keys: dictionary.keys()
	- set of values: dictionary.values()
	- no order to the pairs
	- d.has_key(key) to see if the key has a value to check there will be no error
	- d.items() takes each pair and returns it as tuple
	- dict(list) to make list into a tuple - will remove and only take first value
}

- functions {
	- x for x in <list> if <condition>
}

- notepad {
	- highlight a section then ctrl+q will toggle comments
}

- can change types between list and tuples with the function of the same names

- random numbers {
	- from import random
	- random.random() gives # from (0,1)
	- random.randint(x,y) gives # from [x,y]
	- random.sample(<list>, #)
}

- assingment {
	hist(elements):
		#return a dict in form
		{element: # of occurrences}
}
